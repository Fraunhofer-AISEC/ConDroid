ConDroid
==========================

This project is a fork and extension of the Acteve project on concolic execution for Android (https://code.google.com/p/acteve/)


ConDroid performs <i>concolic</i> execution of Android apps - a combination of pure symbolic and concrete execution of a program which has first been describen in [1] for C programs. 
The goal of ConDroid is to drive execution of Android app to specific code locations without requiring any manual interaction with the app. This allows to observe "interesting" behavior in a dynamic analysis, such as network traffic or dynamic code loading.
